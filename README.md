# what is NodeJS
 Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes     JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting. The ability to run JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. 

# What you can do with NodeJS

    Web servers and websites
    REST APIs
    Real-time apps (like chat)
    Command-line tools
    Working with files and databases
    IoT and hardware control
# NodeJS Built in Modules
 Node.js comes with many built-in modules to help you work with files, servers, paths, the operating system, and more.
 You can use them by importing them with require().

# What is npm ?
npm is the package manager for Node.js.
It helps you install and manage third-party packages (libraries) to add more features to your apps.

# Using the REPL

The Node.js REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is an interactive shell for executing JavaScript code.
The REPL is started by running node in the terminal:

# What is the V8 Engine?
The V8 engine is Google's open-source JavaScript engine, used by Chrome and Node.js.
It compiles JavaScript to native machine code for fast execution.

    Origin: Developed by Google for Chrome in 2008
    Integration: Node.js uses V8 to provide JavaScript runtime on the server
    Features: Just-In-Time compilation, efficient garbage collection, ES6+ support

# Why V8 Makes Node.js Fast
    Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation: Converts JavaScript into optimized machine code instead of interpreting it
    Hidden Classes: Optimizes property access on JavaScript objects
    Efficient Garbage Collection: Manages memory to prevent leaks and optimize performance
    Inline Caching: Speeds up property access by remembering where to find object properties

 # Understanding V8's Role in Node.js
V8 provides the core JavaScript execution environment that Node.js is built upon.
It allows Node.js to:

    Execute JavaScript code outside the browser
    Access operating system functionality (file system, networking, etc.)
    Use the same JavaScript engine that powers Chrome for consistency


# Node.js Architecture
Node.js uses a single-threaded, event-driven architecture that is designed to handle many connections at once, efficiently and without blocking the main thread.
This makes Node.js ideal for building scalable network applications, real-time apps, and APIs.

Key Characteristics: Non-blocking I/O, event-driven, single-threaded with event loop, asynchronous execution.
<============ Node.js Architecture Diagram ===========>


1. Client Request Phase

    Clients send requests to the Node.js server
    Each request is added to the Event Queue

2. Event Loop Phase

    The Event Loop continuously checks the Event Queue
    Picks up requests one by one in a loop

3. Request Processing

    Simple (non-blocking) tasks are handled immediately by the main thread
    Complex/blocking tasks are offloaded to the Thread Pool

4. Response Phase

    When blocking tasks complete, their callbacks are placed in the Callback Queue
    Event Loop processes callbacks and sends responses

When to Use Node.js

Node.js is particularly well-suited for:

    I/O-bound applications - File operations, database queries, network requests
    Real-time applications - Chat apps, live notifications, collaboration tools
    APIs - RESTful services, GraphQL APIs
    Microservices - Small, independent services


# Node.js Event Loop
What is the Event Loop?
The event loop is what makes Node.js non-blocking and efficient.
It handles asynchronous operations by delegating tasks to the system and processing their results through callbacks,
allowing Node.js to manage thousands of concurrent connections with a single thread.

# How the Event Loop Works
Node.js follows these steps to handle operations:
    Execute the main script (synchronous code)
    Process any microtasks (Promises, process.nextTick)
    Execute timers (setTimeout, setInterval)
    Run I/O callbacks (file system, network operations)
    Process setImmediate callbacks
    Handle close events (like socket.on('close'))

# Event Loop Phases
    Timers: setTimeout, setInterval
    I/O Callbacks: Completed I/O operations
    Poll: Retrieve new I/O events
    Check: setImmediate callbacks
    Close: Cleanup callbacks (like socket.on('close'))

# Why is the Event Loop Important?
The event loop enables Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single thread, making it perfect for:
    Real-time applications
    APIs and microservices
    Data streaming
    Chat applications

# Node.js uses an event loop to handle async operations
# Different types of callbacks have different priorities
# Microtasks (Promises) run before the next event loop phase
# This non-blocking model enables high concurrency

# Node.js Asynchronous
In Node.js, asynchronous operations let your program do other work while waiting for tasks like file I/O or network requests to complete.
This non-blocking approach enables Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections efficiently.

# Introduction to Promises
Promises in Node.js provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations compared to traditional callbacks.
Promises represent the completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its result.

Promise States

    Pending: Initial state, operation not completed
    Fulfilled: Operation completed successfully
    Rejected: Operation failed

Once a promise is settled (either fulfilled or rejected), its state cannot change.

Promise.then()
The then() method takes up to two arguments. The arguments are callback functions for the success and failure cases for the Promise.

Promise.catch()
The catch() method handles rejected promises and is equivalent to .then(null, errorHandler).

Promise.finally()
The finally() method executes code regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Promise.all() for Parallel Execution
Promise.all() is used to run multiple promises in parallel, and wait for ALL of them to complete. It fails fast if any promise rejects.

# Introduction to Async/Await
Async/await makes asynchronous code look and more feel like synchronous code. It does not block the main thread, but is easy to follow and understand.

Syntax and Usage
The syntax consists of two keywords:
    async: Used to declare an asynchronous function that returns a Promise
    await: Used to pause execution until a Promise is resolved, can only be used inside async functions

Best practice among them 
1.async functions always return Promises
2.Use Promise.all for concurrent operations
3.Always handle errors
4.Avoid mixing async/await with callbacks
5.Create clean async functions
