 Nodejs For beginners For Typescript with details


# what is NodeJS
 Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes     JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting. The ability to run JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. 

# What you can do with NodeJS

    Web servers and websites
    REST APIs
    Real-time apps (like chat)
    Command-line tools
    Working with files and databases
    IoT and hardware control
# NodeJS Built in Modules
 Node.js comes with many built-in modules to help you work with files, servers, paths, the operating system, and more.
 You can use them by importing them with require().

# Using the REPL

The Node.js REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is an interactive shell for executing JavaScript code.
The REPL is started by running node in the terminal:

# What is the V8 Engine?
The V8 engine is Google's open-source JavaScript engine, used by Chrome and Node.js.
It compiles JavaScript to native machine code for fast execution.

    Origin: Developed by Google for Chrome in 2008
    Integration: Node.js uses V8 to provide JavaScript runtime on the server
    Features: Just-In-Time compilation, efficient garbage collection, ES6+ support

# Why V8 Makes Node.js Fast
    Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation: Converts JavaScript into optimized machine code instead of interpreting it
    Hidden Classes: Optimizes property access on JavaScript objects
    Efficient Garbage Collection: Manages memory to prevent leaks and optimize performance
    Inline Caching: Speeds up property access by remembering where to find object properties

 # Understanding V8's Role in Node.js
V8 provides the core JavaScript execution environment that Node.js is built upon.
It allows Node.js to:

    Execute JavaScript code outside the browser
    Access operating system functionality (file system, networking, etc.)
    Use the same JavaScript engine that powers Chrome for consistency


# Node.js Architecture
Node.js uses a single-threaded, event-driven architecture that is designed to handle many connections at once, efficiently and without blocking the main thread.
This makes Node.js ideal for building scalable network applications, real-time apps, and APIs.

Key Characteristics: Non-blocking I/O, event-driven, single-threaded with event loop, asynchronous execution.
<============ Node.js Architecture Diagram ===========>


1. Client Request Phase

    Clients send requests to the Node.js server
    Each request is added to the Event Queue

2. Event Loop Phase

    The Event Loop continuously checks the Event Queue
    Picks up requests one by one in a loop

3. Request Processing

    Simple (non-blocking) tasks are handled immediately by the main thread
    Complex/blocking tasks are offloaded to the Thread Pool

4. Response Phase

    When blocking tasks complete, their callbacks are placed in the Callback Queue
    Event Loop processes callbacks and sends responses

When to Use Node.js

Node.js is particularly well-suited for:

    I/O-bound applications - File operations, database queries, network requests
    Real-time applications - Chat apps, live notifications, collaboration tools
    APIs - RESTful services, GraphQL APIs
    Microservices - Small, independent services


# Node.js Event Loop
What is the Event Loop?
The event loop is what makes Node.js non-blocking and efficient.
It handles asynchronous operations by delegating tasks to the system and processing their results through callbacks,
allowing Node.js to manage thousands of concurrent connections with a single thread.

# How the Event Loop Works
Node.js follows these steps to handle operations:
    Execute the main script (synchronous code)
    Process any microtasks (Promises, process.nextTick)
    Execute timers (setTimeout, setInterval)
    Run I/O callbacks (file system, network operations)
    Process setImmediate callbacks
    Handle close events (like socket.on('close'))

# Event Loop Phases
    Timers: setTimeout, setInterval
    I/O Callbacks: Completed I/O operations
    Poll: Retrieve new I/O events
    Check: setImmediate callbacks
    Close: Cleanup callbacks (like socket.on('close'))

# Why is the Event Loop Important?
The event loop enables Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single thread, making it perfect for:
    Real-time applications
    APIs and microservices
    Data streaming
    Chat applications

# Node.js uses an event loop to handle async operations
# Different types of callbacks have different priorities
# Microtasks (Promises) run before the next event loop phase
# This non-blocking model enables high concurrency

# Node.js Asynchronous
In Node.js, asynchronous operations let your program do other work while waiting for tasks like file I/O or network requests to complete.
This non-blocking approach enables Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections efficiently.

# Sync vs Async: Key Differences
<img width="914" height="185" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ed0d9a9-4e41-4891-bfa4-36121ca9d726" />

# Introduction to Promises
Promises in Node.js provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations compared to traditional callbacks.
Promises represent the completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its result.

Promise States

    Pending: Initial state, operation not completed
    Fulfilled: Operation completed successfully
    Rejected: Operation failed

Once a promise is settled (either fulfilled or rejected), its state cannot change.

<img width="1241" height="422" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d61d0dd0-d03a-4174-b4ea-056684ca2425" />

Promise.then()
The then() method takes up to two arguments. The arguments are callback functions for the success and failure cases for the Promise.

Promise.catch()
The catch() method handles rejected promises and is equivalent to .then(null, errorHandler).

Promise.finally()
The finally() method executes code regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Promise.all() for Parallel Execution
Promise.all() is used to run multiple promises in parallel, and wait for ALL of them to complete. It fails fast if any promise rejects.

# Introduction to Async/Await
Async/await makes asynchronous code look and more feel like synchronous code. It does not block the main thread, but is easy to follow and understand.

Syntax and Usage
The syntax consists of two keywords:
    async: Used to declare an asynchronous function that returns a Promise
    await: Used to pause execution until a Promise is resolved, can only be used inside async functions

   <img width="1240" height="316" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93746b45-8072-45f0-a425-7e26167b3242" />


Best practice among them 
1.async functions always return Promises
2.Use Promise.all for concurrent operations
3.Always handle errors
4.Avoid mixing async/await with callbacks
5.Create clean async functions

# Node.js Modules
Modules are the building blocks of Node.js applications, allowing you to organize code into logical, reusable components.
  *  Organizing code into manageable files
  *  Encapsulating functionality
  *  Preventing global namespace pollution
  *  Improving code maintainability and reusability

# What is NPM?
NPM is a package manager for Node.js packages, or modules.

# What is a Package?

# NodeJS Http Module
Node.js includes a powerful built-in HTTP module that enables you to create HTTP servers and make HTTP requests.

This module is essential for building web applications and APIs in Node.js.
Key Features

    Create HTTP servers to handle requests and send responses
    Make HTTP requests to other servers
    Handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
    Work with request and response headers
    Handle streaming data for large payloads

# Working with HTTP Headers

HTTP headers let you send additional information with your response.
The res.writeHead() method is used to set the status code and response headers.

# Common HTTP Status Codes
 # Code 	Message 	Description
 # 200 	OK 	Standard response for successful HTTP requests
 # 201 	Created 	Request has been fulfilled and new resource created
 # 301 	Moved Permanently 	Resource has been moved to a new URL
 # 400 	Bad Request 	Server cannot process the request due to client error
 # 401 	Unauthorized 	Authentication is required
 # 403 	Forbidden 	Server refuses to authorize the request
 # 404 	Not Found 	Requested resource could not be found
 # 500 	Internal Server Error 	Unexpected condition was encountered


# Common Response Headers
    Content-Type: Specifies the media type of the content (e.g., text/html, application/json)
    Content-Length: The length of the response body in bytes
    Location: Used in redirects (with 3xx status codes)
    Set-Cookie: Sets HTTP cookies on the client
    Cache-Control: Directives for caching mechanisms
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: For CORS support

# Common URL Parsing Methods
    url.parse(urlString, [parseQueryString], [slashesDenoteHost]): Parse a URL string into an object
    url.format(urlObject): Format a URL object into a URL string
    url.resolve(from, to): Resolve a target URL relative to a base URL
    new URL(input, [base]): The WHATWG URL API (recommended for new code)
    querystring.parse(str, [sep], [eq], [options]): Parse a query string into an object
    querystring.stringify(obj, [sep], [eq], [options]): Stringify an object into a query string

# Introduction to the HTTPS Module

The HTTPS module is a core Node.js module that provides an implementation of the HTTPS protocol, which is essentially HTTP over TLS/SSL.

It's a secure version of the HTTP module, providing encrypted communication between clients and servers.

# Why Use HTTPS?
HTTPS is crucial for modern web applications because it:

    Encrypts Data: Protects sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, and personal data from eavesdropping
    Authenticates Servers: Verifies that clients are communicating with the intended server
    Ensures Data Integrity: Prevents data from being modified or corrupted during transfer
    Builds Trust: Visual indicators (like the padlock icon) increase user confidence
    Improves SEO: Search engines prioritize HTTPS websites in search results
    Enables Modern Features: Many web APIs (like Geolocation, Service Workers) require HTTPS

# How HTTPS Works
    Client initiates a secure connection to the server
    Server presents its SSL/TLS certificate to the client
    Client verifies the certificate with a trusted Certificate Authority (CA)
    Encrypted session is established using asymmetric encryption
    Symmetric encryption is used for the actual data transfer

# SSL/TLS Certificates
HTTPS requires SSL/TLS certificates to establish secure connections. There are several types of certificates:

# Types of Certificates
    Self-Signed Certificates: For development and testing (not trusted by browsers)
    Domain Validated (DV): Basic validation, just verifies domain ownership
    Organization Validated (OV): Validates organization details
    Extended Validation (EV): Highest level of validation, shows company name in browser
    Wildcard Certificates: Secures all subdomains of a domain
    Multi-Domain (SAN) Certificates: Secures multiple domains with one certificate

# Security Best Practices:
    Always use the latest stable version of Node.js for security updates
    Keep your dependencies up to date using `npm audit` and `npm update`
    Use environment variables for sensitive configuration (never commit secrets to version control)
    Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
    Regularly rotate your SSL/TLS certificates
    Monitor your server for security vulnerabilities
    Use a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache in production for additional security features

# Best Practices for HTTPS Requests:
    Always validate and sanitize input data before sending it in a request
    Use environment variables for sensitive information like API keys
    Implement proper error handling and timeouts
    Set appropriate headers (Content-Type, Accept, User-Agent)
    Handle redirects appropriately (3xx status codes)
    Implement retry logic for transient failures
    Consider using a library like axios or node-fetch for more complex scenarios

# Best Practices for Express.js with HTTPS:
    Always use helmet middleware for security headers
    Set secure session options (if using sessions)
    Use environment variables for configuration
    Implement proper error handling and logging
    Use a reverse proxy in production
    Keep your dependencies up to date
    Use HTTP/2 for better performance
    Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
    Use CORS middleware if your API is accessed from different domains

 # Node JS File System
 The Node.js File System module (fs) provides a comprehensive set of methods for working with the file system on your computer.
  It allows you to perform file I/O operations in both synchronous and asynchronous ways.
  <img width="645" height="216" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95e4b08e-dfbe-4fbd-a612-3806928d411e" />

  # Node Path Module 
  What is the Path Module?
  The Path module is a built-in Node.js module that provides tools for handling and transforming file paths across different operating systems.
  Since Windows uses backslashes (\) and POSIX systems (Linux, macOS) use forward slashes (/), the Path module helps write cross-platform code that works correctly on any system.
  <img width="608" height="217" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5d188cd-1b5b-422e-80fc-f32450dd5e0d" />

  # OS Module 
  What is the OS Module?
  The OS module in Node.js provides a powerful set of utilities for interacting with the underlying operating system.
  It offers a cross-platform way to access system-related information and perform common operating system tasks.

  # Key Features:
    Retrieve system information (CPU, memory, platform)
    Access user and network information
    Work with file paths and directories in a cross-platform way
    Monitor system resources and performance
    Handle operating system signals and errors
    
  # Events
  Every action on a computer is an event, like when a connection is made or a file is opened.
  Objects in Node.js can fire events, like the readStream object fires events when opening and closing a file.

  Node.js uses an event-driven architecture where objects called "emitters" emit named events that cause 
  function objects ("listeners") to be called.

 # Streams
 What are Streams?

In Node.js, streams are collections of data, which might not be available in full at once and don't have to fit in memory.
Think of them as conveyor belts that move data from one place to another, allowing you to work with each piece as it arrives rather than waiting for the whole dataset.
Streams are one of Node.js's most powerful features and are used extensively in:
    File system operations (reading/writing files)
    HTTP requests and responses
    Data compression and decompression
    Database operations
    Real-time data processing
    
 # Why Use Streams?
 There are several advantages to using streams:
    Memory Efficiency: Process large files without loading them entirely into memory
    Time Efficiency: Start processing data as soon as you have it, instead of waiting for all the data
    Composability: Build powerful data pipelines by connecting streams
    Better User Experience: Deliver data to users as it becomes available .

 # Node.js Crypto Module
 What is the Crypto Module?

The Crypto module is a built-in Node.js module that provides cryptographic functionality including:

    Hash functions (SHA-256, SHA-512, etc.)
    HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)
    Symmetric encryption (AES, DES, etc.)
    Asymmetric encryption (RSA, ECDSA, etc.)
    Digital signatures and verification
    Secure random number generation

The Crypto module is essential for applications that need to handle sensitive information securely.

The Crypto module wraps the OpenSSL library, providing access to well-established and tested cryptographic algorithms.

This module is often used to handle sensitive data, such as:

    User authentication and password storage
    Secure data transmission
    File encryption and decryption
    Secure communication channels

 # Key Concepts for Password Security
    Salting: Add a unique random value to each password before hashing
    Key Stretching: Make the hashing process intentionally slow to prevent brute-force attacks
    Work Factor: Control how computationally intensive the hashing process is

    

# What is a salt?
A salt is a random string that is unique to each user.
It's combined with the password before hashing to ensure that even if two users have the same password, their hashes will be different.
This prevents attackers from using precomputed tables (like rainbow tables) to crack multiple passwords at once.

# HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)
HMAC is a specific type of message authentication code (MAC) involving a cryptographic hash function and a secret cryptographic key.
It provides both data integrity and authentication.

# When to Use HMAC
    API request verification
    Secure cookies and sessions
    Data integrity checks
    Webhook verification

# HMAC Security Properties
    Message Integrity: Any change to the message will produce a different HMAC
    Authenticity: Only parties with the secret key can generate valid HMACs
    No Encryption: HMAC doesn't encrypt the message, only verifies its integrity
