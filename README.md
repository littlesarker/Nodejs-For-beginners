# what is NodeJS
 Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes     JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting. The ability to run JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. 

# What you can do with NodeJS

    Web servers and websites
    REST APIs
    Real-time apps (like chat)
    Command-line tools
    Working with files and databases
    IoT and hardware control
# NodeJS Built in Modules
 Node.js comes with many built-in modules to help you work with files, servers, paths, the operating system, and more.
 You can use them by importing them with require().

# What is npm ?
npm is the package manager for Node.js.
It helps you install and manage third-party packages (libraries) to add more features to your apps.

# Using the REPL

The Node.js REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) is an interactive shell for executing JavaScript code.
The REPL is started by running node in the terminal:

# What is the V8 Engine?
The V8 engine is Google's open-source JavaScript engine, used by Chrome and Node.js.
It compiles JavaScript to native machine code for fast execution.

    Origin: Developed by Google for Chrome in 2008
    Integration: Node.js uses V8 to provide JavaScript runtime on the server
    Features: Just-In-Time compilation, efficient garbage collection, ES6+ support

# Why V8 Makes Node.js Fast
    Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation: Converts JavaScript into optimized machine code instead of interpreting it
    Hidden Classes: Optimizes property access on JavaScript objects
    Efficient Garbage Collection: Manages memory to prevent leaks and optimize performance
    Inline Caching: Speeds up property access by remembering where to find object properties
